# FASCA Hour Tracker
Project created during my senior year to help facilitate hour tracking for the Formosa Association of Student Cultural Ambassadors (San Diego Chapter). This repositories has 3 different webapps: sign in, sign out, and an administrator untilities web app. They are all linked to the main hour tracker google sheets and reads/updates data based off of it.

### Sign In/Out:
- Records time user sign in/out to an event
- Rounds down event attendence hours to the nearest quarter of an hour
- Update the monthly/final hours report and attendence rate

### Administrator App:
- Hours report page to report non-event in club hours or outside hours
- Troubleshoot button that recalculates hours if the Google Sheet layout was messed up
- Reset button
- Recount number of events
